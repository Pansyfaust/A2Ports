- ADDED: Animation and glow material for the blinking yellow light.
- FIXED: Blinking yellow light is now visible again (increased intensity).

Note: this isn't the fully functioning stop lights I've showcased, This is merely fixing the A2 behaviour of the stop lights.
Note 2: Possible binarization issues due to numerical characters in model name. (can be worked around by renaming p3ds and references in model.cfg)
